Module      : Command.Command
License     : BSD (see the LICENSE file)
Description : Everything commands :)

Amateur attempt at command abstraction and polyvariadic magic.

Inspired heavily by calamity-commands, which is provided by Ben Simms 2020
under the MIT license.

Ideally, this module wouldn't need to be touched after its initial creation
(and hence quite the jump in complex GHC extensions compared to other modules),
however it is documented quite extensively anyway.

__As an OwenDev, you do not need to enable any GHC extensions, as the__
__extensions are used internally within this module only__.

==== __Notable extensions used (if you want to know)__

    * ScopedTypeVariables: For using the same type variables in @where@
    statements as function declarations.
    * FlexibleInstances: To allow complex type variables in instance declarations,
    like @CommandHandlerType m (a -> m ())@.
    [Read more]
    (https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/instances.html#extension-FlexibleInstances)
    * FunctionalDependencies: To write that @m@ can be determined from @h@ in
    @CommandHandlerType@. It makes logical sense to tell GHC this because @h@
    must be in the @m@ monad (otherwise, @h@ may be in another monad).
    [Read more]
    (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Advanced_type_classes)
    * MultiParamTypeClasses: For declaring CommandHandlerType that has 2 params.
    This comes with FunctionalDependencies automatically, and is not explicitly
    used.
    * UndecidableInstances: Risky, but I think I logically checked over it. Used
    in the @m (a -> b)@ instance declaration of 'CommandHandlerType', because
    @(a -> b)@ doesn't explicitly determine the required functional dependency
    (@h -> m@). The extension is risky because the type-checker can fail to
    terminate if the instance declarations recursively reference each other. In
    this module however, all instances strictly converges to the @m (m ())@
    instance so I say it is safe. [Read more]
    (https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5zjwym/when_is_undecidableinstances_okay_to_use/)
    * NamedFieldPuns: Shorten pattern matching ADT field names.

{- | A @Command@ is a datatype containing the metadata for a user-registered

{- | @command name handler@ creates a 'Command' named @name@, which upon
receiving a message will run @handler@. The @name@ cannot contain any spaces,
as it breaks the parser. The @handler@ function can take an arbitrary amount
of arguments of arbitrary types (it is polyvariadic), as long as they are
instances of 'ParsableArgument'.

The Command that this function creates is polymorphic in the Monad it is run
in. This means you can call it from 'DiscordHandler' or any other
Monad that satisfies the constraints of 'MonadDiscord'.

==== __See some examples__

@pong@ below responds to a ping by a pong.

@
pong :: (MonadDiscord m) => Command m
pong = command "ping" $ \\msg -> respond msg "pong!"
@

@pong2@ shows that @runCommand@ can be composed to create a normal listener.
That is, it takes a Message and returns a unit action in the desired monad.

@
pong2 :: (MonadDiscord m) => Message -> m ()
pong2 = runCommand $ command "ping" $ \\msg -> respond msg "pong!"
@

@weather@ below shows having arbitrary arguments in action. @location@ is
likely inferred to be 'T.Text'.

@
weather = command "weather" $ \\msg location -> do
    result <- liftIO $ getWeather location
    respond msg $ "Weather at " <> location <> " is " <> result <> "!"
@

@complex@ shows that you can parse any type! (as long as you create an
instance declaration of 'ParsableArgument' for it). You may want to put this in
@Command/Parser.hs@.

@
instance ParsableArgument Int where
    parserForArg = read \<$> many digit -- some Parsec that returns an Int

complex :: (MonadDiscord m) => Command m
complex = command "setLimit" $ \\m i -> do
    respond m $ show (i + 20 / 4 + 78^3) -- i is automatically inferred as Int!

    , commandRequires     = mempty
    }

{- | @onError@ overwrites the default error handler of a command with a custom
implementation. Usually the default 'defaultErrorHandler' suffices.

@
example
    = onError (\\msg e -> respond msg (T.pack $ show e))
    . command "example" $ do
        ...
@
-}

    :: (Message -> CommandError -> m ())

    -- and the error itself. It runs in the same monad as the command handlers.
    -> Command m
    -> Command m
onError errorHandler cmd = cmd { commandErrorHandler = errorHandler }

{- | @prefix@ overwrites the default command prefix ":" of a command with a
custom one. This is ignored if a regex parser is used, however it is still
applicable for 'parsecCommand'.

@
example
    = prefix "->"
    . command "idk" $ do
        ...
@
-}
prefix :: T.Text -> Command m -> Command m
prefix newPrefix cmd = cmd { commandPrefix = newPrefix }

{- | @requires@ adds a requirement to the command. The requirement is a function
that takes a 'Message' and either returns @'Nothing'@ (no problem) or
@'Just' "explanation"@. The function is in the @m@ monad so it can access
any additional information from Discord as necessary.

Commands default to having no requirements.
-}
requires :: Requirement m () -> Command m -> Command m
requires requirement cmd = cmd { commandRequires = requirement }

{- | @help@ sets the help message for the command. The default is "Help not
available."
-}
help :: T.Text -> Command m -> Command m
help newHelp cmd = cmd { commandHelp = newHelp }

{- | @alias@ adds an alias for the command's name. This is ignored if a custom
parser like 'regexCommand' or 'parsecCommand' is used.

Functionally, this is equivalent to defining a new command with the same
handler, however the aliases may not appear on help pages.
-}
alias :: T.Text -> Command m -> Command m
alias newAlias cmd = cmd { commandAliases = newAlias : commandAliases cmd }

{- | @parsecCommand@ defines a command that has no name, and has a custom
parser that begins from the start of a message. It can help things like
"::quotes" because they have special syntax that demands a special parser.

'alias', if used together, is ignored. Other composable functions like 'help',
'prefix', 'requires', and 'onError' are still valid.

The handler __must__ take a 'Message' and a 'String' as argument (nothing
more, nothing less), where the latter is the result of the parser.

@
example
    = requires moderatorPrivs
    . prefix "~~"
    . parsecCommand (string "abc" >> many1 anyChar) $ \\msg quoteName -> do
        ...
         this is triggered on "~~abc\<one or more chars>" where quoteName
         contains the section enclosed in \<>

    }

{- | @regexCommand@ defines a command that has no name, and has a custom
regular expression matcher, that __searches across any part of the message__.

'prefix' and 'alias', if used together, are ignored. Other compoasble
functions like 'help', 'requires', and 'onError' are still valid.

The handler __must__ take a 'Message' and a '[T.Text]' as argument, where
the latter are the list of captured values from the Regex (same as the past
@newCommand@).

    }

{- | @runCommand command msg@ runs the specified 'Command' with the given
message. It first does the initial checks:

For commands registered with 'command', the check will check for the prefix
and the name.

For commands registered with 'regexCommand', the check will check against the
regex.

For commands registered with 'parsecCommand', the check will check for the
prefix and the custom parser.

Any failures during this stage is silently ignored, as it may still be a valid
command elsewhere. After this, the requirements are checked (chance, priv, etc).
Finally, the @commandApplier@ is called. Any errors inside the handler is
caught and appropriately handled.

{- $commonerrors

| Here are some common errors that can occur when defining commands.
They may appear cryptic, but they are most of the time dealable.

@
Could not deduce (ParsableArgument p0) arising from the use of \'command'.
The type variable 'p0' is ambiguous.
@

    * The type for one of the arguments to your handler function cannot
    be inferred. Make sure you use the argument, otherwise, just remove it.

@
Could not deduce (ParsableArgument SomeType) arising from the use of
\'command'.
@

    * The type could be inferred as SomeType, but it's not an instance
    of ParsableArgument. Contribute your own parser in @Command/Parser.hs@.

@
Could not deduce (MonadIO m) arising from the use of \'liftIO'.
@

    * Your handler requires IO actions, but you haven't given the
    appropriate constraint. Add @(MonadIO m)@.
    * Rationale: This happens because some handlers are pure and don't need IO -
    it's better to explicitly signify which actions you're going to use
    in the constraints than to add a catch-all constraint into the
    definition of @MonadDiscord@.

If an error is super duper cryptic, it may be a bug in the Commands
module itself, in which case we may need a rewrite.
