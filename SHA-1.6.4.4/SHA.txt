-- | Implementations of the SHA suite of message digest functions
--   
--   This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions,
--   according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well as
--   the SHA-based HMAC routines. The functions have been tested against
--   most of the NIST and RFC test vectors for the various functions. While
--   some attention has been paid to performance, these do not presently
--   reach the speed of well-tuned libraries, like OpenSSL.
@package SHA
@version 1.6.4.4


-- | Pure implementations of the SHA suite of hash functions. The
--   implementation is basically an unoptimized translation of FIPS 180-2
--   into Haskell. If you're looking for performance, you probably won't
--   find it here.
module Data.Digest.Pure.SHA

-- | An abstract datatype for digests.
data Digest t
data SHA1State
data SHA256State
data SHA512State

-- | Convert a digest to a string. The digest is rendered as fixed with
--   hexadecimal number.
showDigest :: Digest t -> String

-- | Convert a digest to an Integer.
integerDigest :: Digest t -> Integer

-- | Convert a digest to a ByteString.
bytestringDigest :: Digest t -> ByteString

-- | Compute the SHA-1 hash of the given ByteString. The output is
--   guaranteed to be exactly 160 bits, or 20 bytes, long. This is a good
--   default for programs that need a good, but not necessarily
--   hyper-secure, hash function.
sha1 :: ByteString -> Digest SHA1State

-- | Compute the SHA-224 hash of the given ByteString. Note that SHA-224
--   and SHA-384 differ only slightly from SHA-256 and SHA-512, and use
--   truncated versions of the resulting hashes. So using 224/384 may not,
--   in fact, save you very much ...
sha224 :: ByteString -> Digest SHA256State

-- | Compute the SHA-256 hash of the given ByteString. The output is
--   guaranteed to be exactly 256 bits, or 32 bytes, long. If your security
--   requirements are pretty serious, this is a good choice. For truly
--   significant security concerns, however, you might try one of the
--   bigger options.
sha256 :: ByteString -> Digest SHA256State

-- | Compute the SHA-384 hash of the given ByteString. Yup, you guessed it,
--   the output will be exactly 384 bits, or 48 bytes, long.
sha384 :: ByteString -> Digest SHA512State

-- | For those for whom only the biggest hashes will do, this computes the
--   SHA-512 hash of the given ByteString. The output will be 64 bytes, or
--   512 bits, long.
sha512 :: ByteString -> Digest SHA512State
