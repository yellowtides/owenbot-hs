@package req
@version 3.2.0


-- | The documentation below is structured in such a way that the most
--   important information is presented first: you learn how to do HTTP
--   requests, how to embed them in any monad you have, and then it gives
--   you details about less-common things you may want to know about. The
--   documentation is written with sufficient coverage of details and
--   examples, and it's designed to be a complete tutorial on its own.
--   
--   <i>(A modest intro goes here, click on <a>req</a> to start making
--   requests.)</i>
--   
--   <h3>About the library</h3>
--   
--   Req is an easy-to-use, type-safe, expandable, high-level HTTP client
--   library that just works without any fooling around.
--   
--   What does the phrase “easy-to-use” mean? It means that the library is
--   designed to be beginner-friendly so it's simple to add to your monad
--   stack, intuitive to work with, well-documented, and does not get in
--   your way. Doing HTTP requests is a common task and Haskell library for
--   this should be very approachable and clear to beginners, thus certain
--   compromises were made. For example, one cannot currently modify
--   <a>ManagerSettings</a> of the default manager because the library
--   always uses the same implicit global manager for simplicity and
--   maximal connection sharing. There is a way to use your own manager
--   with different settings, but it requires a bit more typing.
--   
--   “Type-safe” means that the library is protective and eliminates
--   certain classes of errors. For example, we have
--   correct-by-construction <a>Url</a>s, it's guaranteed that the user
--   does not send the request body when using methods like <a>GET</a> or
--   <a>OPTIONS</a>, and the amount of implicit assumptions is minimized by
--   making the user specify his/her intentions in an explicit form (for
--   example, it's not possible to avoid specifying the body or method of
--   request). Authentication methods that assume HTTPS force the user to
--   use HTTPS at the type level. The library also carefully hides
--   underlying types from the lower-level <tt>http-client</tt> package
--   because those types are not safe enough (for example <a>Request</a> is
--   an instance of <a>IsString</a> and, if it's malformed, it will blow up
--   at run-time).
--   
--   “Expandable” refers to the ability of the library to be expanded
--   without having to resort to ugly hacking. For example, it's possible
--   to define your own HTTP methods, create new ways to construct the body
--   of a request, create new authorization options, perform a request in a
--   different way, and create your own methods to parse and represent a
--   response. As the user extends the library to satisfy his/her special
--   needs, the new solutions will work just like the built-ins. However,
--   all of the common cases are also covered by the library
--   out-of-the-box.
--   
--   “High-level” means that there are less details to worry about. The
--   library is a result of my experiences as a Haskell consultant. Working
--   for several clients, who had very different projects, showed me that
--   the library should adapt easily to any particular style of writing
--   Haskell applications. For example, some people prefer throwing
--   exceptions, while others are concerned with purity. Just define
--   <a>handleHttpException</a> accordingly when making your monad instance
--   of <a>MonadHttp</a> and it will play together seamlessly. Finally, the
--   library cuts down boilerplate considerably, and helps you write
--   concise, easy to read, and maintainable code.
--   
--   <h3>Using with other libraries</h3>
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>You won't need the low-level interface of <tt>http-client</tt>
--   most of the time, but when you do, it's better to do a qualified
--   import, because <tt>http-client</tt> has naming conflicts with
--   <tt>req</tt>.</li>
--   <li>For streaming of large request bodies see the companion package
--   <tt>req-conduit</tt>:
--   <a>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-conduit</a>.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   <h3>Lightweight, no risk solution</h3>
--   
--   The library uses the following mature packages under the hood to
--   guarantee you the best experience:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client</a>—low level
--   HTTP client used everywhere in Haskell.</li>
--   <li><a>https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-tls</a>—TLS
--   (HTTPS) support for <tt>http-client</tt>.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   It's important to note that since we leverage well-known libraries
--   that the whole Haskell ecosystem uses, there is no risk in using
--   <tt>req</tt>. The machinery for performing requests is the same as
--   with <tt>http-conduit</tt> and <tt>wreq</tt>. The only difference is
--   the API.
module Network.HTTP.Req

-- | Make an HTTP request. The function takes 5 arguments, 4 of which
--   specify required parameters and the final <a>Option</a> argument is a
--   collection of optional parameters.
--   
--   Let's go through all the arguments first: <tt>req method url body
--   response options</tt>.
--   
--   <tt>method</tt> is an HTTP method such as <a>GET</a> or <a>POST</a>.
--   The documentation has a dedicated section about HTTP methods below.
--   
--   <tt>url</tt> is a <a>Url</a> that describes location of resource you
--   want to interact with.
--   
--   <tt>body</tt> is a body option such as <a>NoReqBody</a> or
--   <a>ReqBodyJson</a>. The tutorial has a section about HTTP bodies, but
--   usage is very straightforward and should be clear from the examples
--   below.
--   
--   <tt>response</tt> is a type hint how to make and interpret response of
--   an HTTP request. Out-of-the-box it can be the following:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li><a>ignoreResponse</a></li>
--   <li><a>jsonResponse</a></li>
--   <li><a>bsResponse</a> (to get a strict <a>ByteString</a>)</li>
--   <li><a>lbsResponse</a> (to get a lazy <a>ByteString</a>)</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   Finally, <tt>options</tt> is a <a>Monoid</a> that holds a composite
--   <a>Option</a> for all other optional settings like query parameters,
--   headers, non-standard port number, etc. There are quite a few things
--   you can put there, see the corresponding section in the documentation.
--   If you don't need anything at all, pass <a>mempty</a>.
--   
--   <b>Note</b> that if you use <a>req</a> to do all your requests,
--   connection sharing and reuse is done for you automatically.
--   
--   See the examples below to get on the speed quickly.
--   
--   <h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
--   
--   First, this is a piece of boilerplate that should be in place before
--   you try the examples:
--   
--   <pre>
--   {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric     #-}
--   {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
--   
--   module Main (main) where
--   
--   import Control.Monad
--   import Control.Monad.IO.Class
--   import Data.Aeson
--   import Data.Maybe (fromJust)
--   import Data.Monoid ((&lt;&gt;))
--   import Data.Text (Text)
--   import GHC.Generics
--   import Network.HTTP.Req
--   import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as B
--   import qualified Text.URI as URI
--   </pre>
--   
--   We will be making requests against the <a>https://httpbin.org</a>
--   service.
--   
--   Make a GET request, grab 5 random bytes:
--   
--   <pre>
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
--     let n :: Int
--         n = 5
--     bs &lt;- req GET (https "httpbin.org" /: "bytes" /~ n) NoReqBody bsResponse mempty
--     liftIO $ B.putStrLn (responseBody bs)
--   </pre>
--   
--   The same, but now we use a query parameter named <tt>"seed"</tt> to
--   control seed of the generator:
--   
--   <pre>
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
--     let n, seed :: Int
--         n    = 5
--         seed = 100
--     bs &lt;- req GET (https "httpbin.org" /: "bytes" /~ n) NoReqBody bsResponse $
--       "seed" =: seed
--     liftIO $ B.putStrLn (responseBody bs)
--   </pre>
--   
--   POST JSON data and get some info about the POST request:
--   
--   <pre>
--   data MyData = MyData
--     { size  :: Int
--     , color :: Text
--     } deriving (Show, Generic)
--   
--   instance ToJSON MyData
--   instance FromJSON MyData
--   
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
--     let myData = MyData
--           { size  = 6
--           , color = "Green" }
--     v &lt;- req POST (https "httpbin.org" /: "post") (ReqBodyJson myData) jsonResponse mempty
--     liftIO $ print (responseBody v :: Value)
--   </pre>
--   
--   Sending URL-encoded body:
--   
--   <pre>
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
--     let params =
--           "foo" =: ("bar" :: Text) &lt;&gt;
--           queryFlag "baz"
--     response &lt;- req POST (https "httpbin.org" /: "post") (ReqBodyUrlEnc params) jsonResponse mempty
--     liftIO $ print (responseBody response :: Value)
--   </pre>
--   
--   Using various optional parameters and URL that is not known in
--   advance:
--   
--   <pre>
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
--     -- This is an example of what to do when URL is given dynamically. Of
--     -- course in a real application you may not want to use 'fromJust'.
--     uri &lt;- URI.mkURI "https://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar"
--     let (url, options) = fromJust (useHttpsURI uri)
--     response &lt;- req GET url NoReqBody jsonResponse $
--       "from" =: (15 :: Int)           &lt;&gt;
--       "to"   =: (67 :: Int)           &lt;&gt;
--       basicAuth "username" "password" &lt;&gt;
--       options                         &lt;&gt; -- contains the ?foo=bar part
--       port 443 -- here you can put any port of course
--     liftIO $ print (responseBody response :: Value)
--   </pre>
req :: (MonadHttp m, HttpMethod method, HttpBody body, HttpResponse response, HttpBodyAllowed (AllowsBody method) (ProvidesBody body)) => method -> Url scheme -> body -> Proxy response -> Option scheme -> m response

-- | A version of <a>req</a> that does not use one of the predefined
--   instances of <a>HttpResponse</a> but instead allows the user to
--   consume <tt><a>Response</a> <a>BodyReader</a></tt> manually, in a
--   custom way.
reqBr :: (MonadHttp m, HttpMethod method, HttpBody body, HttpBodyAllowed (AllowsBody method) (ProvidesBody body)) => method -> Url scheme -> body -> Option scheme -> (Response BodyReader -> IO a) -> m a

-- | Mostly like <a>req</a> with respect to its arguments, but accepts a
--   callback that allows to perform a request in arbitrary fashion.
--   
--   This function <i>does not</i> perform handling/wrapping exceptions,
--   checking response (with <a>httpConfigCheckResponse</a>), and retrying.
--   It only prepares <a>Request</a> and allows you to use it.
req' :: forall m method body scheme a. (MonadHttp m, HttpMethod method, HttpBody body, HttpBodyAllowed (AllowsBody method) (ProvidesBody body)) => method -> Url scheme -> body -> Option scheme -> (Request -> Manager -> m a) -> m a

-- | Perform an action using the global implicit <a>Manager</a> that the
--   rest of the library uses. This allows to reuse connections that the
--   <a>Manager</a> controls.
withReqManager :: MonadIO m => (Manager -> m a) -> m a

-- | A type class for monads that support performing HTTP requests.
--   Typically, you only need to define the <a>handleHttpException</a>
--   method unless you want to tweak <a>HttpConfig</a>.
class MonadIO m => MonadHttp m

-- | This method describes how to deal with <a>HttpException</a> that was
--   caught by the library. One option is to re-throw it if you are OK with
--   exceptions, but if you prefer working with something like
--   <a>MonadError</a>, this is the right place to pass it to
--   <a>throwError</a>.
handleHttpException :: MonadHttp m => HttpException -> m a

-- | Return <a>HttpConfig</a> to be used when performing HTTP requests.
--   Default implementation returns its <tt>def</tt> value, which is
--   described in the documentation for the type. Common usage pattern with
--   manually defined <a>getHttpConfig</a> is to return some hard-coded
--   value, or a value extracted from <a>MonadReader</a> if a more flexible
--   approach to configuration is desirable.
getHttpConfig :: MonadHttp m => m HttpConfig

-- | <a>HttpConfig</a> contains general and default settings to be used
--   when making HTTP requests.
data HttpConfig
HttpConfig :: Maybe Proxy -> Int -> Maybe Manager -> (forall b. Request -> Response b -> ByteString -> Maybe HttpExceptionContent) -> RetryPolicyM IO -> (forall b. RetryStatus -> Response b -> Bool) -> HttpConfig

-- | Proxy to use. By default values of <tt>HTTP_PROXY</tt> and
--   <tt>HTTPS_PROXY</tt> environment variables are respected, this setting
--   overwrites them. Default value: <a>Nothing</a>.
[httpConfigProxy] :: HttpConfig -> Maybe Proxy

-- | How many redirects to follow when getting a resource. Default value:
--   10.
[httpConfigRedirectCount] :: HttpConfig -> Int

-- | Alternative <a>Manager</a> to use. <a>Nothing</a> (default value)
--   means that the default implicit manager will be used (that's what you
--   want in 99% of cases).
[httpConfigAltManager] :: HttpConfig -> Maybe Manager

-- | Function to check the response immediately after receiving the status
--   and headers, before streaming of response body. The third argument is
--   the beginning of response body (typically first 1024 bytes). This is
--   used for throwing exceptions on non-success status codes by default
--   (set to <tt>\_ _ _ -&gt; Nothing</tt> if this behavior is not
--   desirable).
--   
--   When the value this function returns is <a>Nothing</a>, nothing will
--   happen. When it there is <a>HttpExceptionContent</a> inside
--   <a>Just</a>, it will be thrown.
--   
--   Throwing is better then just returning a request with non-2xx status
--   code because in that case something is wrong and we need a way to
--   short-cut execution (also remember that Req retries automatically on
--   request timeouts and such, so when your request fails, it's certainly
--   something exceptional). The thrown exception is caught by the library
--   though and is available in <a>handleHttpException</a>.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: signature of this function was changed in the version
--   <i>1.0.0</i>.
[httpConfigCheckResponse] :: HttpConfig -> forall b. Request -> Response b -> ByteString -> Maybe HttpExceptionContent

-- | The retry policy to use for request retrying. By default <tt>def</tt>
--   is used (see <a>RetryPolicyM</a>).
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: signature of this function was changed in the version
--   <i>1.0.0</i>.
[httpConfigRetryPolicy] :: HttpConfig -> RetryPolicyM IO

-- | The function is used to decide whether to retry a request. <a>True</a>
--   means that the request should be retried.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: signature of this function was changed in the version
--   <i>1.0.0</i>.
[httpConfigRetryJudge] :: HttpConfig -> forall b. RetryStatus -> Response b -> Bool

-- | Default value of <a>HttpConfig</a>.
defaultHttpConfig :: HttpConfig

-- | A monad that allows to run <a>req</a> in any <a>IO</a>-enabled monad
--   without having to define new instances.
data Req a

-- | Run a computation in the <a>Req</a> monad with the given
--   <a>HttpConfig</a>. In case of exceptional situation an
--   <a>HttpException</a> will be thrown.
runReq :: MonadIO m => HttpConfig -> Req a -> m a

-- | <a>GET</a> method.
data GET
GET :: GET

-- | <a>POST</a> method.
data POST
POST :: POST

-- | <a>HEAD</a> method.
data HEAD
HEAD :: HEAD

-- | <a>PUT</a> method.
data PUT
PUT :: PUT

-- | <a>DELETE</a> method. This data type does not allow having request
--   body with <a>DELETE</a> requests, as it should be. However some APIs
--   may expect <a>DELETE</a> requests to have bodies, in that case define
--   your own variation of <a>DELETE</a> method and allow it to have a
--   body.
data DELETE
DELETE :: DELETE

-- | <a>TRACE</a> method.
data TRACE
TRACE :: TRACE

-- | <a>CONNECT</a> method.
data CONNECT
CONNECT :: CONNECT

-- | <a>OPTIONS</a> method.
data OPTIONS
OPTIONS :: OPTIONS

-- | <a>PATCH</a> method.
data PATCH
PATCH :: PATCH

-- | A type class for types that can be used as an HTTP method. To define a
--   non-standard method, follow this example that defines <tt>COPY</tt>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   data COPY = COPY
--   
--   instance HttpMethod COPY where
--     type AllowsBody COPY = 'CanHaveBody
--     httpMethodName Proxy = "COPY"
--   </pre>
class HttpMethod a where {
    
    -- | Type function <a>AllowsBody</a> returns a type of kind
    --   <a>CanHaveBody</a> which tells the rest of the library whether the
    --   method can have body or not. We use the special type
    --   <a>CanHaveBody</a> lifted to the kind level instead of <a>Bool</a> to
    --   get more user-friendly compiler messages.
    type family AllowsBody a :: CanHaveBody;
}

-- | Return name of the method as a <a>ByteString</a>.
httpMethodName :: HttpMethod a => Proxy a -> ByteString

-- | Request's <a>Url</a>. Start constructing your <a>Url</a> with
--   <a>http</a> or <a>https</a> specifying the scheme and host at the same
--   time. Then use the <tt>(<a>/~</a>)</tt> and <tt>(<a>/:</a>)</tt>
--   operators to grow the path one piece at a time. Every single piece of
--   path will be url(percent)-encoded, so using <tt>(<a>/~</a>)</tt> and
--   <tt>(<a>/:</a>)</tt> is the only way to have forward slashes between
--   path segments. This approach makes working with dynamic path segments
--   easy and safe. See examples below how to represent various <a>Url</a>s
--   (make sure the <tt>OverloadedStrings</tt> language extension is
--   enabled).
--   
--   <h4><b>Examples</b></h4>

data Url (scheme :: Scheme)

-- | Given host name, produce a <a>Url</a> which has “http” as its scheme
--   and empty path. This also sets port to <tt>80</tt>.
http :: Text -> Url 'Http

-- | Given host name, produce a <a>Url</a> which has “https” as its scheme
--   and empty path. This also sets port to <tt>443</tt>.
https :: Text -> Url 'Https

-- | Grow given <a>Url</a> appending a single path segment to it. Note that

--   <a>ToHttpApiData</a>.
(/~) :: ToHttpApiData a => Url scheme -> a -> Url scheme
infixl 5 /~

-- | Type-constrained version of <tt>(<a>/~</a>)</tt> to remove ambiguity
--   in the cases when next URL piece is a <a>Text</a> literal.
(/:) :: Url scheme -> Text -> Url scheme
infixl 5 /:

-- | The <a>useHttpURI</a> function provides an alternative method to get
--   <a>Url</a> (possibly with some <a>Option</a>s) from a <a>URI</a>. This
--   is useful when you are given a URL to query dynamically and don't know
--   it beforehand.
--   
--   This function expects the scheme to be “http” and host to be present.
useHttpURI :: URI -> Maybe (Url 'Http, Option scheme)

-- | Just like <a>useHttpURI</a>, but expects the “https” scheme.
useHttpsURI :: URI -> Maybe (Url 'Https, Option scheme)

-- | A combination of <a>useHttpURI</a> and <a>useHttpsURI</a> for cases
--   when scheme is not known in advance.
useURI :: URI -> Maybe (Either (Url 'Http, Option scheme0) (Url 'Https, Option scheme1))

-- | A quasiquoter to build an <a>Url</a> and <a>Option</a> tuple. The type
--   of the generated expression is <tt>(<a>Url</a> scheme0, <a>Option</a>
--   scheme1)</tt> with <tt>scheme0</tt> being either <a>Http</a> or
--   <a>Https</a> depending on the input.
urlQ :: QuasiQuoter

-- | This data type represents empty body of an HTTP request. This is the
--   data type to use with <a>HttpMethod</a>s that cannot have a body, as
--   it's the only type for which <a>ProvidesBody</a> returns
--   <a>NoBody</a>.
--   
--   Using of this body option does not set the <tt>Content-Type</tt>
--   header.
data NoReqBody
NoReqBody :: NoReqBody

-- | This body option allows to use a JSON object as request body—probably
--   the most popular format right now. Just wrap a data type that is an
--   instance of <a>ToJSON</a> type class and you are done: it will be
--   converted to JSON and inserted as request body.
--   
--   This body option sets the <tt>Content-Type</tt> header to
--   <tt>"application/json; charset=utf-8"</tt> value.
newtype ReqBodyJson a
ReqBodyJson :: a -> ReqBodyJson a

-- | This body option streams request body from a file. It is expected that
--   the file size does not change during the streaming.
--   
--   Using of this body option does not set the <tt>Content-Type</tt>
--   header.
newtype ReqBodyFile
ReqBodyFile :: FilePath -> ReqBodyFile

-- | HTTP request body represented by a strict <a>ByteString</a>.
--   
--   Using of this body option does not set the <tt>Content-Type</tt>
--   header.
newtype ReqBodyBs
ReqBodyBs :: ByteString -> ReqBodyBs

-- | HTTP request body represented by a lazy <a>ByteString</a>.
--   
--   Using of this body option does not set the <tt>Content-Type</tt>
--   header.
newtype ReqBodyLbs
ReqBodyLbs :: ByteString -> ReqBodyLbs

-- | Form URL-encoded body. This can hold a collection of parameters which
--   are encoded similarly to query parameters at the end of query string,
--   with the only difference that they are stored in request body. The
--   similarity is reflected in the API as well, as you can use the same
--   combinators you would use to add query parameters:
--   <tt>(<a>=:</a>)</tt> and <a>queryFlag</a>.
--   
--   This body option sets the <tt>Content-Type</tt> header to
--   <tt>"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</tt> value.
newtype ReqBodyUrlEnc
ReqBodyUrlEnc :: FormUrlEncodedParam -> ReqBodyUrlEnc

-- | An opaque monoidal value that allows to collect URL-encoded parameters
--   to be wrapped in <a>ReqBodyUrlEnc</a>.
data FormUrlEncodedParam

-- | Multipart form data. Please consult the
--   <a>Network.HTTP.Client.MultipartFormData</a> module for how to
--   construct parts, then use <a>reqBodyMultipart</a> to create actual
--   request body from the parts. <a>reqBodyMultipart</a> is the only way
--   to get a value of the type <a>ReqBodyMultipart</a>, as its constructor
--   is not exported on purpose.

data ReqBodyMultipart

-- | Create <a>ReqBodyMultipart</a> request body from a collection of
--   <a>Part</a>s.
reqBodyMultipart :: MonadIO m => [Part] -> m ReqBodyMultipart

-- | A type class for things that can be interpreted as an HTTP
--   <a>RequestBody</a>.
class HttpBody body

-- | How to get actual <a>RequestBody</a>.
getRequestBody :: HttpBody body => body -> RequestBody

-- | This method allows us to optionally specify the value of
--   <tt>Content-Type</tt> header that should be used with particular body
--   option. By default it returns <a>Nothing</a> and so
--   <tt>Content-Type</tt> is not set.
getRequestContentType :: HttpBody body => body -> Maybe ByteString

-- | The type function recognizes <a>NoReqBody</a> as having <a>NoBody</a>,
--   while any other body option <a>CanHaveBody</a>. This forces the user
--   to use <a>NoReqBody</a> with <a>GET</a> method and other methods that
--   should not have body.
type family ProvidesBody body :: CanHaveBody

-- | This type function allows any HTTP body if method says it
--   <a>CanHaveBody</a>. When the method says it should have <a>NoBody</a>,
--   the only body option to use is <a>NoReqBody</a>.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: users of GHC 8.0.1 and later will see a slightly more
--   friendly error message when method does not allow a body and body is
--   provided.
type family HttpBodyAllowed (allowsBody :: CanHaveBody) (providesBody :: CanHaveBody) :: Constraint

-- | The opaque <a>Option</a> type is a <a>Monoid</a> you can use to pack
--   collection of optional parameters like query parameters and headers.
--   See sections below to learn which <a>Option</a> primitives are
--   available.
data Option (scheme :: Scheme)

-- | This operator builds a query parameter that will be included in URL of
--   your request after the question sign <tt>?</tt>. This is the same
--   syntax you use with form URL encoded request bodies.
--   
--   This operator is defined in terms of <a>queryParam</a>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   name =: value = queryParam name (pure value)
--   </pre>
(=:) :: (QueryParam param, ToHttpApiData a) => Text -> a -> param
infix 7 =:

-- | Construct a flag, that is, valueless query parameter. For example, in
--   the following URL <tt>"a"</tt> is a flag, while <tt>"b"</tt> is a
--   query parameter with a value:
--   
--   <pre>
--   https://httpbin.org/foo/bar?a&amp;b=10
--   </pre>
--   
--   This operator is defined in terms of <a>queryParam</a>:
--   
--   <pre>
--   queryFlag name = queryParam name (Nothing :: Maybe ())
--   </pre>
queryFlag :: QueryParam param => Text -> param

-- | A type class for query-parameter-like things. The reason to have an
--   overloaded <a>queryParam</a> is to be able to use it as an
--   <a>Option</a> and as a <a>FormUrlEncodedParam</a> when constructing
--   form URL encoded request bodies. Having the same syntax for these
--   cases seems natural and user-friendly.
class QueryParam param

-- | Create a query parameter with given name and value. If value is
--   <a>Nothing</a>, it won't be included at all (i.e. you create a flag
--   this way). It's recommended to use <tt>(<a>=:</a>)</tt> and
--   <a>queryFlag</a> instead of this method, because they are easier to
--   read.
queryParam :: (QueryParam param, ToHttpApiData a) => Text -> Maybe a -> param

-- | Create an <a>Option</a> that adds a header. Note that if you
--   <a>mappend</a> two headers with the same names the leftmost header
--   will win. This means, in particular, that you cannot create a request
--   with several headers of the same name.
header :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Option scheme

-- | Attach a header with given name and content to a <a>Request</a>.
attachHeader :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Request -> Request

-- | Use the given <a>CookieJar</a>. A <a>CookieJar</a> can be obtained
--   from a <a>Response</a> record.
cookieJar :: CookieJar -> Option scheme

-- | The <a>Option</a> adds basic authentication.
--   
--   See also:
--   <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication</a>.
basicAuth :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Option 'Https

-- | An alternative to <a>basicAuth</a> which works for any scheme. Note
--   that using basic access authentication without SSL/TLS is vulnerable
--   to attacks. Use <a>basicAuth</a> instead unless you know what you are
--   doing.
basicAuthUnsafe :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Option scheme

-- | The <a>Option</a> set basic proxy authentication header.
basicProxyAuth :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Option scheme

-- | The <a>Option</a> adds OAuth1 authentication.
oAuth1 :: ByteString -> ByteString -> ByteString -> ByteString -> Option scheme

-- | The <a>Option</a> adds an OAuth2 bearer token. This is treated by many
--   services as the equivalent of a username and password.
--   
--   The <a>Option</a> is defined as:
--   
--   <pre>
--   oAuth2Bearer token = header "Authorization" ("Bearer " &lt;&gt; token)
--   </pre>
--   
--   See also: <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth</a>.
oAuth2Bearer :: ByteString -> Option 'Https

-- | The <a>Option</a> adds a not-quite-standard OAuth2 bearer token (that
--   seems to be used only by GitHub). This will be treated by whatever
--   services accept it as the equivalent of a username and password.
--   
--   The <a>Option</a> is defined as:
--   
--   <pre>
--   oAuth2Token token = header "Authorization" ("token" &lt;&gt; token)
--   </pre>
--   
--   See also:
--   <a>https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth#3-use-the-access-token-to-access-the-api</a>.
oAuth2Token :: ByteString -> Option 'Https

-- | A helper to create custom authentication <a>Option</a>s. The given
--   <a>IO</a>-enabled request transformation is applied after all other
--   modifications when constructing a request. Use wisely.
customAuth :: (Request -> IO Request) -> Option scheme

-- | Specify the port to connect to explicitly. Normally, <a>Url</a> you
--   use determines the default port: <tt>80</tt> for HTTP and <tt>443</tt>
--   for HTTPS. This <a>Option</a> allows to choose an arbitrary port
--   overwriting the defaults.
port :: Int -> Option scheme

-- | This <a>Option</a> controls whether gzipped data should be
--   decompressed on the fly. By default everything except for
--   <tt>"application/x-tar"</tt> is decompressed, i.e. we have:
--   
--   <pre>
--   decompress (/= "application/x-tar")
--   </pre>
--   
--   You can also choose to decompress everything like this:
--   
--   <pre>
--   decompress (const True)
--   </pre>
decompress :: (ByteString -> Bool) -> Option scheme

-- | Specify the number of microseconds to wait for response. The default
--   value is 30 seconds (defined in <a>ManagerSettings</a> of connection
--   <a>Manager</a>).
responseTimeout :: Int -> Option scheme

-- | HTTP version to send to the server, the default is HTTP 1.1.
httpVersion :: Int -> Int -> Option scheme

-- | Make a request and ignore the body of the response.
data IgnoreResponse

-- | Use this as the fourth argument of <a>req</a> to specify that you want
--   it to ignore the response body.
ignoreResponse :: Proxy IgnoreResponse

-- | Make a request and interpret the body of the response as JSON. The
--   <a>handleHttpException</a> method of <a>MonadHttp</a> instance
--   corresponding to monad in which you use <a>req</a> will determine what
--   to do in the case when parsing fails (the <a>JsonHttpException</a>
--   constructor will be used).
data JsonResponse a

-- | Use this as the fourth argument of <a>req</a> to specify that you want
--   it to return the <a>JsonResponse</a> interpretation.
jsonResponse :: Proxy (JsonResponse a)

-- | Make a request and interpret the body of the response as a strict
--   <a>ByteString</a>.
data BsResponse

-- | Use this as the fourth argument of <a>req</a> to specify that you want
--   to interpret the response body as a strict <a>ByteString</a>.
bsResponse :: Proxy BsResponse

-- | Make a request and interpret the body of the response as a lazy
--   <a>ByteString</a>.
data LbsResponse

-- | Use this as the fourth argument of <a>req</a> to specify that you want
--   to interpret the response body as a lazy <a>ByteString</a>.
lbsResponse :: Proxy LbsResponse

-- | Get the response body.
responseBody :: HttpResponse response => response -> HttpResponseBody response

-- | Get the response status code.
responseStatusCode :: HttpResponse response => response -> Int

-- | Get the response status message.
responseStatusMessage :: HttpResponse response => response -> ByteString

-- | Lookup a particular header from a response.
responseHeader :: HttpResponse response => response -> ByteString -> Maybe ByteString

-- | Get the response <a>CookieJar</a>.
responseCookieJar :: HttpResponse response => response -> CookieJar

-- | A type class for response interpretations. It allows to describe how
--   to consume response from a <tt><a>Response</a> <a>BodyReader</a></tt>
--   and produce the final result that is to be returned to the user.
class HttpResponse response where {
    
    -- | The associated type is the type of body that can be extracted from an
    --   instance of <a>HttpResponse</a>.
    type family HttpResponseBody response :: Type;
}

-- | The method describes how to get the underlying <a>Response</a> record.
toVanillaResponse :: HttpResponse response => response -> Response (HttpResponseBody response)

-- | This method describes how to consume response body and, more
--   generally, obtain <tt>response</tt> value from <tt><a>Response</a>
--   <a>BodyReader</a></tt>.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: <a>BodyReader</a> is nothing but <tt><a>IO</a>
--   <a>ByteString</a></tt>. You should call this action repeatedly until
--   it yields the empty <a>ByteString</a>. In that case streaming of
--   response is finished (which apparently leads to closing of the
--   connection, so don't call the reader after it has returned the empty
--   <a>ByteString</a> once) and you can concatenate the chunks to obtain
--   the final result. (Of course you could as well stream the contents to
--   a file or do whatever you want.)
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: signature of this function was changed in the version
--   <i>1.0.0</i>.
getHttpResponse :: HttpResponse response => Response BodyReader -> IO response

-- | The value of <tt>"Accept"</tt> header. This is useful, for example, if
--   a website supports both <tt>XML</tt> and <tt>JSON</tt> responses, and
--   decides what to reply with based on what <tt>Accept</tt> headers you
--   have sent.
--   
--   <b>Note</b>: manually specified <tt>Options</tt> that set the
--   <tt>"Accept"</tt> header will take precedence.
acceptHeader :: HttpResponse response => Proxy response -> Maybe ByteString

-- | Exceptions that this library throws.
data HttpException

-- | A wrapper with an <a>HttpException</a> from <a>Network.HTTP.Client</a>
VanillaHttpException :: HttpException -> HttpException

-- | A wrapper with Aeson-produced <a>String</a> describing why decoding
--   failed
JsonHttpException :: String -> HttpException

-- | A simple type isomorphic to <a>Bool</a> that we only have for better
--   error messages. We use it as a kind and its data constructors as
--   type-level tags.
--   
--   See also: <a>HttpMethod</a> and <a>HttpBody</a>.
data CanHaveBody

-- | Indeed can have a body
CanHaveBody :: CanHaveBody

-- | Should not have a body
NoBody :: CanHaveBody

-- | A type-level tag that specifies URL scheme used (and thus if HTTPS is
--   enabled). This is used to force TLS requirement for some
--   authentication <a>Option</a>s.
